# Toshiko

This project aim to provide a set of tool allowing small communities to organise anime series into multiple list based
on their status (watching, watched, simulcast, etc...)

You can see this as a shared anilist or myanimelist account, for discord.

The project use French as the main language, as every message sent on Discord through the bot will be in French.
Exception, comments and every other bit of the application destined to the developer's usage are in english.

Although it is planned to add localisation support in the future, for now I want to focus my efforts into coding more
feature and providing a cleaner codebase, hence, this repository might go under multiple rewrite until I'm satisfied
with it.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- JDK 17+

This readme will be updated to include installation process / contribution guideline once the project will be ready to
be at this stage. If you are brave enough, you can still clone this repository and analyze the content
of `.env.example`.
